I am a fullstack developer living in Vancouver BC Canada. I have been programming on and off for around 20 years. I started with Visual Basic and then MS Access.
After that it was Lua and then MS SQL Server. But now I mainly use Javascript or JAMStack to be more exact.

Here is a list of my current tools/frameworks/services.

- Next.js
- React.js
- Tailwindcss
- Python
- Firebase `Database, hosting, cloud functios and more...`
- Vercel `Hosting`
- Webstorm `IDE`
- VS Code `IDE`
- Userbase `Database`

It is amazing what you can create with these tools and services. Most of what I have created lately has been for
internal use. Mostly tools that make employeeâ€™s lives easier and streamline processes, .
