Clara Software is a software company that specializes in high-quality custom web apps. We build secure, scalable, and user-friendly products that are designed to increase your productivity and drive your business forward.

I am a fullstack developer based in Vancouver BC Canada. I started 25 years ago with Visual Basic and then MS Access.
After that it was Lua and then MS SQL Server. But now I mainly use Javascript.

Here is a list of my current tools/frameworks/services.

- Next.js
- React.js
- Tailwindcss
- Python
- Firebase `Database, hosting, cloud functions and more...`
- Vercel `Hosting`
- Webstorm `IDE`
- VS Code `IDE`
- Userbase `Database`

It is amazing what you can create with these tools and services. Most of what we have created lately has been for
internal use. Mostly tools that make employeeâ€™s lives easier and streamline processes, .
