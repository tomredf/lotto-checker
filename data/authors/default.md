We are fullstack developers based in Vancouver BC Canada. We started 20 years ago with Visual Basic and then MS Access.
After that it was Lua and then MS SQL Server. But now we mainly use Javascript or JAMStack to be more exact.

Here is a list of our current tools/frameworks/services.

- Next.js
- React.js
- Tailwindcss
- Python
- Firebase `Database, hosting, cloud functions and more...`
- Vercel `Hosting`
- Webstorm `IDE`
- VS Code `IDE`
- Userbase `Database`

It is amazing what you can create with these tools and services. Most of what we have created lately has been for
internal use. Mostly tools that make employeeâ€™s lives easier and streamline processes, .
