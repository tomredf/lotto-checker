## Introduction

In May 2015, I started working for a small company with around 20 employees. It was a construction materials supply company with two locations.
One was an office/sales centre/showroom, and the other was a distribution centre. This post will outline the problems with the old system,
the challenges faced, and the solutions I found to make it all work.

## Existing setup

The existing setup was all Windows. The sales order system was running on a remote Windows Server, accessed by each user from a Windows computer
using Remote Desktop. These user machines were old and very, very slow. These machines needed replacing badly.

Each user had their own Gmail account and saved files to their local hard drives, which meant that other than the sales order system,
nothing was centralized, backed up or secured.

## First Things First

Before doing anything else, we switched to a paid G Suite account and linked it to the company domain. Now everyone had a proper company email address,
which could be all centrally managed. Of course, this also meant access to all the Google Docs apps and Google Drive for file storage. This change alone
was a vast improvement, but we still had those slow machines, and users could still save files to their local hard drives.

## Chromeboxes To The Rescue

After lots of research, I concluded that Chromeboxes was the solution. We could have used Chromebooks, but everyone worked at a desk and wanted one or
two large monitors. We went with HP Chromeboxes, which were inexpensive. Setup was easy, and we signed up for Google Chrome Device Management, making
it easy to configure or wipe any enrolled device remotely.

## Advantages

The first significant advantage is that users log on to the device using their company Gmail account. It then loads up the Chrome browser with Gmail,
Google Drive and all the Google docs apps. It also made it easy for multiple employees to share one Chromebox.

The second significant advantage was that the device booted up fast, which meant they could be productive way more quickly in the mornings. Some of the
old Windows machines took 5 to 10 minutes to become useable.

Then, of course, there was security; this setup is way more secure than the old Windows machines. We didn’t have to worry about viruses or anything like that.

If a Chromebox died, we did not lose anything, as everything is in the cloud. Just plug in a new Chromebox, enroll it in the device admin, let the user login,
and away you go. No files are lost, and it only takes 10 minutes to get the user back working again.

A bonus was we could use Google Sites to create internal websites for resources for employees. Things like a knowledge base, product specs and information etc.

## Obstacles

The first obstacle was how do we connect to the Windows server from chrome. The chrome browser has some remote desktop functionality, but it did not work
for our needs, so we had to find a better solution.

The biggest obstacle we faced was printing. We needed to print from the remote desktop and from the local chrome devices. At the time, the only way of printing
from a chrome box was via Google Cloud Print. This is great for printing locally from the Chrome boxes to local or remote printers, but on its own, you could
not use it to print from a Windows server accessed by remote desktop. We tried various workarounds like printing to PDF etc. but none of them were practical,
especially when you need to print work orders packing slips invoices etc. This one almost made us change our minds and go back to Windows machines.
When accessing a remote Windows server from a Windows machine, your local network printers are forwarded to the remote server so you can print as if the server
was connected to your printers.

## Solutions

For Remote Desktop, I found a great solution called [Xtralogic](https://www.xtralogic.com/remote-desktop-client-for-chrome). Xtralogic is a chrome app that lets you connect to a remote computer via remote desktop.
It runs in its own window, and you can even make it fullscreen. It costs around $10 per user per year, which is very reasonable. It’s been working great
for years now, and I highly recommend it.

It took a while to find a solution that would let us print from the remote windows server to local printers. In the end, what worked well for us was
Google Cloud Print for Windows, which is software that enhances Google Cloud Print. You install it on the Windows machine that has the printers connected to it,
and you install it on the remote Windows server. Then you connect it to the Google account that controls the printers, and then it lets you create virtual
printers on the server from the Google Cloud Printers. You can print from any software program on the windows server as if the printer was connected directly to the server.

## Conclusion

All in all, it is worked out very well, and here we are five years later, and things are still going strong. Of course, now we are faced with a new challenge,
as Google has decided to get rid of Google Cloud Print. So we have until the end of December 2020 to come up with a new printing solution for the remote
Windows server. So far, I have not been able to find a suitable replacement. So this could mean we have to go back to local Windows machines, but I’m still
hoping I can find a solution to avoid that.

> ### Printing Update
>
> At the beginning of 2021, Google shut down Coud Print. We had plenty of warning so we had time to find a replacement. After trying a few different options,
> we found that [Printix](https://printix.net) was the perfect solution. It turns out it is considerably better than Google Cloud Print so we are very happy with it.
> Google Cloud Print was free but Printix only costs around $30 per month.
