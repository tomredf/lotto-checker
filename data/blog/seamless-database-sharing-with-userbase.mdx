## What Is Userbase

[Userbase](https://userbase.com) is a pretty new service that lets you create secure and private web apps using only static JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I have been using it almost from the beginning, and I love it.

My current app is for use within a company, with many users having access to the same database. So the database sharing feature of
Userbase will come in very handy. The way database sharing works is you call the `shareDatabase()` function passing it the username of an
existing user and the database’s name. See the example below.

```js:shareDatabase()
userbase.shareDatabase({
  databaseName: 'example-database-name',
  username: 'alice'
}).then(() => {
  // Alice can now access the database
}).catch((e) => console.error(e))
```

Now the user you just shared it with must get the databaseId of the shared database to open it. To do this, you use the `getDatabases()`
function, as seen in the example below.

```js:getDatabases()
userbase.getDatabases().then((databases) => {
  // databases result available
}).catch((e) => console.error(e))
```

They can pass in the database name if they know it to return the one database and get the databaseId. Once they have the databaseId,
they can open the database.

While this all works great, in my case, where I am dealing with non-technical users, none of this was practical, so I had to develop a
better solution.

## My Solution

Keep in mind that this only applies to situations where multiple users need to use the same database within a company or organization.
The first user to sign up within the app becomes the admin. When they log in for the first time, the app creates a new database.
The user does not need to know the name of the database. They can now use the app as usual.

To add new users, the admin user can sign them up (recommended) or let them sign up themselves. As each new user is added and
automatically signed in, the app creates a new database. These new users should not use the app yet, which means they will never
use the just-created database.

The admin can now log in with their account and start sharing the database with the new users. All they have to do is enter the
username and click a button. See the image below.

The Add User button calls the `shareDatabase()` function passing it the database name and username.

The option to add users is only available to the admin, so I had to add a way to determine if a user was an admin.
The solution turned out to be relatively straightforward. If there is only one database, then they are the admin.
If there is more than one, then they are a regular user. There will be two databases because one database was created
when the first sign up and log in, and then one database is shared with them. Here is the code I used.

```js:getDatabases()
// Check to see if it is an admin user or a regular user
    userbase.getDatabases().then((res) => {
      if (res.databases.length == 1) {
        isAdmin = true
        userType = 'Admin'
        users = res.databases[0].users
      }
      else {
        isAdmin = false
        userType = 'User'
        databaseId = res.databases[1].databaseId
        users = []
      }
    }).catch((e) => console.error(e))
```

If the databases’ length is equal to 1, they are an admin, so I set some variables and get the list of all users who have
access to the database. They will have access to features like adding, viewing and removing users. If the length of
databases is greater than 1, they are regular users, which means they won’t have access to features like adding, viewing and
removing users. We also grab the `databaseId` of the second database (which is the shared one) in the array. The `databaseId` is
required to work with a shared database.

All database actions require either the `databaseName` if it is not a shared database, or `databaseId` if it is a shared database.

The admin can remove users by simply selecting them from a drop-down list and click a button.

## Conclusion

We end up with a completely seamless experience where no one needs to know or enter the databaseName or databaseId.
The users don’t even need to know they are sharing a database. They are just adding users, which is great for non-technical users.
